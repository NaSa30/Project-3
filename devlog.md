This is my start of my development of this project.

First before I dived into the coding part, I needed to do a deep research in how to create a repository and publish my branch into my
Github account from VS Code. It did ended up taking a while for me to finally understand the process.
Now I will be starting off my code, where I would first create the simple loop of the menu and commands, and then go into a brief research
on bytes in the Python language.

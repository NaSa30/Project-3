This is my start of my development of this project.

First before I dived into the coding part, I needed to do a deep research in how to create a repository and publish my branch into my
Github account from VS Code. It did ended up taking a while for me to finally understand the process.

Now I will be starting off my code, where I would first create the simple loop of the menu and commands, and then go into a brief research
on bytes in the Python language.

After creating the menu, I've decided to do a bit of research on binary files and BTrees in Python language, in order to have a better understanding
for the project. Throughout this side practice, I now understand how to create and read from binary files and convert strings or integers into binary. 
For the BTree it helped me clarify my confusion on how to rearrange the BTree whenever a node meets its
degree limit. I do still get a bit confuse with the calculation on how the nodes gets split. 


My next step in this project is to create the BTree for the Index File, and also having the functions to be able to use/create binary files.

I've realized that starting off from creating from the BTree had led me to big confusion. Instead, I've decided to create the command functions
first as I develop the BTree class and Node class.

Unfortunetly I was unable to complete this project.
I have came across a few problems mainly on my BTrees, where I've mostly test it on two arrays (representing the value and keys).
The issue I've came accross was first sorting by the keys, and second calculations in splitting the children nodes array.
In this session, sadly my goal to finish was not met. But my goal in learning more aboout bytes and conversion have greatky expanded.
Throught my next session I was thinking about how I would be able to apply many methods into this code.
